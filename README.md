Greetings!  
Welcome to our repository of code, data, and presentation materials for our second case study. 

The goal of this project is to explore employee attrition data for DDSAnalytics.  They believe data science will be able to help them leverage more wide ranging talent management solutions.  Our team has been tasked with finding the major factors in employee attrition and identifying trends that could help lower that attrition rate.  

We've included a RMD file with the source R code to support our claims as well as a Codebook (located in the code folder) explaining our table structures. Also included is a powerpoint with summary materials, and a PowerBi dashboard for exploratory data analysis. 

We'd like to thank you all for visiting our repository and wish you all long happy lives.  

Love,
Team TAM
